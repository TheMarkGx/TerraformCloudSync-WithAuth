## Project Overview

A simple but functional demonstration showing how Unity can send and retrieve game save data with AWS services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.) deployed by Terraform in a highly scalable environment.

## Architecture Diagram

Provide a simple visual showing how Unity communicates with AWS services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- Unity (C#)
- AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM)
- Terraform
- JSON / HTTP

## Infrastructure Setup (Terraform)

Explain:
- File structure
- Required variables
- Deployment steps
- Destroy instructions

## Unity Integration

Document:
- JSON save structure
- UnityWebRequest setup
- Save/load behavior in the game

## Security Model

Explain:
- IAM roles and policies
- How the API is protected
- Tradeoffs and limitations

## Scalability Considerations

Discuss:
- Optional services like SQS or Cognito
- How this system could grow for multi-user support or scale

## Future Improvements

Outline:
- Features not implemented
- Additional ideas (auth, CI/CD, monitoring, retries)

## How to Run This Project

Step-by-step:
- Prerequisites (AWS CLI, Terraform, Unity version)
- Setup
- Testing
- Cleanup
